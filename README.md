# RustResearch

This software uses the rand crate to do some simple arithmetic. It uses it with some if statements to print out various statements depending on the sum or product of the two random numbers. 

The purpose for this software was to use it as a crash course for Rust as I continue to work with this language. 

# Developmental Environment
I used the cargo tool in my terminal and used VS Code as my editor. 

I used Rust and the Rand Crate.

# Future Work 
- Random Dice Roll Generator to Do a DND-Style Skill Check 
- Using the Rand crate results for more conditionals in if statements/for loops
